Abstract Class:
A class that is declared with "abstract" keyword is called as Abstract class.

/*Syntax for abstract Class*/
abstract class MyAbstract{
	//body of abstract class
}

Note:
1)Abstract class methods are by default public.
2)Abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods(implementation should be provided).
3)All abstract methods of abstract class should be provide implementaion in subclass by overriding.
4)In abstract class, abstract-method's should be declared with abstract keyword.
5)In abstract class, abstract-method's shouldn't be declare with private keyword.
6)If you are extending any abstract class that have abstract method, you must either provide the implementation of the method (or) make this class abstract.
7)Abstract class cannot have final abstract methods(like final abstract void echo(){//body} in example programs).
8)Abstract class can have final non-abstract methods(like final void cout(){//body} in example programs).
