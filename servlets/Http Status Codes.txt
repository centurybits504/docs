Http Status Codes:
A status code is a numeric value with 3 digits. W3C divided all the status codes broadly into 5 categories
starting with digit 1 (of type 1xx), with digit 2 (of type 2xx), with digit 3 (of type 3xx), with digit 4 (of type 4xx) and with digit 5 (of type 5xx).
Status Codes Classification in Web:
1. Status codes with Prefix 1 (of type 1xx) : Meant for just Information
2. Status codes with Prefix 2 (of type 2xx) : Means that Web Server accepted the request successfully
3. Status codes with Prefix 3 (of type 3xx) : Meant for Redirection (Used when Server redirects the request)
4. Status codes with Prefix 4 (of type 4xx) : Client does some errors in requesting
5. Status codes with Prefix 5 (of type 5xx) : Resource is available on the server and server is able to locate it but still unable to exeucte it.
