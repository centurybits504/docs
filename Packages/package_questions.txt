Do I need to import java.lang package any time? Why ?
No. It is by default loaded internally by the JVM.

Can I import same package/class twice? Will the JVM load the package twice at runtime?
One can import the same package or same class multiple times. Neither compiler nor JVM complains
abt it. And the JVM will internally load the class only once no matter how many times you import the
same class.

What is the default package?
java.lang.*; package

What is exception occur when declared package does not match expected packege?
java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem
