Java Annotation is nothing but  a tag represents the metadata attached to java elements like<br> class, interface, methods, variables, enums, another annotations 
to indicate some additional<br> 
information which can be used by the compiler and JVM.<br>
An annotation gives data about a program. It is not part of the program itself and no direct effect on the operation of the code.<br>
Annotations are alternate option to XML and java-marker-interfaces, because they provide additional information.<br>
<br>
<b><font color=\"#0091EA\">Uses of Annotations:</font></b><br>
Annotations uses the runtime process.<br>
Software tools can process annotation information to generate code, XML files.<br>
Annotations helps the compiler to detect errors or suppress warnings.<br>
<br>
<b><font color=\"#0091EA\">Rules for defining Java annotations:</font></b><br>
Annotation declaration should start with an sign like @, following with an interface keyword, following with the annotation name.<br>
Method declarations should not have any throws clauses.<br>
Method declarations should not have any parameters.<br>
Return types of the method should be one of the following:<br>
	primitives<br>
	String<br>
	Class<br>
	enum<br>
	array of the above types<br>
<br>
<b><font color=\"#0091EA\">Java specifies the set of annotations which are built into the language</font></b> <br>	
Some of the Built-In Java Annotations used in java code:<br>
<b><font color=\"#0091EA\">@Override :</font></b> Checks that the function is an override. 
Causes a compile warning if the function is not found in one of the parent classes.<br>

<b><font color=\"#0091EA\">@Deprecated :</font></b> Marks the function as absolute. <br>Causes a compile warning if the f unction is used. When we want to inform the 
compiler that a method is deprecated we can use this. <br>
So, when a method is annotated with @Deprecated and that method is found used in some place, then the compiler generates a warning.<br><br>

<b><font color=\"#0091EA\">@SuppressWarnings : </font></b> Instructs the compiler to suppress the compile time warnings specified in the annotation parameters. <br><br>

<b><font color=\"#0091EA\">@SafeVarargs : </font></b> when applied to a method or constructor, asserts that the code does not perform
 potentially unsafe operations on its varargsparameter. <br>
When this annotation type is used, unchecked warnings relating to varargs usage are suppressed.<br>
<b><font color=\"#0091EA\">@FunctionalInterface :</font></b> Introduced in Java SE 8, indicates that the type declaration is intended to be 
a functional interface, as defined by the Java Language Specification.<br><br>

<b><font color=\"#0091EA\">Some of the Built-In Java Annotations used in other annotations:</font></b><br>
<b><font color=\"#0091EA\">@Retention : </font></b> Specifies how the marked annotation is stored.
Whether in code only, compiled into the class, or available at runtime through reflection.<br>
<b><font color=\"#0091EA\">@Inherited : </font></b>  Marks another annotation to be inherited to subclasses of annotated class (by default annotations are not inherited to subclasses).<br><br>
<b><font color=\"#0091EA\">@Documented : </font></b> Marks another annotation for inclusion in the documentation.<br><br>
<b><font color=\"#0091EA\">@Target : </font></b> Marks another annotation to restrict what kind of java elements the annotation may be applied.<br><br>
