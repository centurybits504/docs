What is the use of "this" keyword?
this is a reference variable that is used to refer current class object.

What "this" cannot be used in static context?
this keyword can't be used in static context, because “this” refers to an Current Calling Object.
Static methods are not part of any object, so "this" cann't use in static context.

Why Constructor call must be the first statement in a constructor?
Because it's present in the Java Language Specification: a call to another constructor in the same class (or) to a constructor in the super class must go in the first line. 
It's a way to ensure that the parent's state is initialized before initializing the current object.
