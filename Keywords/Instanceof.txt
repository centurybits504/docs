InstanceOf :
instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type i.e, class or subclass or interface.
The instanceof is also known as type comparison operator, because it compares the instance with type and it returns either true or false.
The instanceOf operator returns false, if we apply to any variable that has null value (or) to "null" directly.
