
String is a class in java.lan package.
In java all classes are considered as datatypes.so we can consider String as a datatypes also.
Because a class is also called as datatype.

There are 2 ways to create Strings in java.
1) String str = \"Hello\"; //by string literal
2) String str = new String(\"Hello\"); //by new keyword

String objects are stored in the special memory called String Constant Pool,
where  new object are not created if object already exist in the String Constant Pool.
This helps in memory management of java.


Difference Between String str ="Hello";	 and String str = new String("Hello"); ?
In  String str ="Hello"; - assignment operator is used to assigh the string literal to the string variable str.
JVM first check whether the same object is already available in the String Constant Pool.
If the object is available in the String Constant Pool, then jvm creates reference to it.
If the object is not available in the String Constant Pool, then jvm creates new object with the content "Hello".

In String str = new String(\"Hello\");  -  new  keyword is used to create the String object.
In this case JVM  always creates a new object without checking in the String Constant Pool.

String objects are immutable objects whose objects cannot be modified.
