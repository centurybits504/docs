Collection Framework:
In computer systems, a framework is often a layered structure indicating what kind of programs can or should be built and how they would interrelate.

Collection can be defined as a group where various things are gathered together to form a single unit.

In Java collection can be defined as a container that constitute a group of objects.
A Collection is simply an object that groups multiple elements into single unit.
Collection framework first introduced with J2SE version 1.2
A framework in java provides readymade architecture represents set of classes and interfaces.
In java collections are defined in the java.util.* package.

Collection framework represents unified architecture for sorting and manipulating group of objects.
It has,
		1: interfaces and it's implementations(classes)
		2: Algorithms


		
		
What is the need of collection framework in java?
Arrays are not resizable.
Java Collections Framework provides lots of different useful data types, such as linked lists (allows insertion anywhere in constant time), resizeable array lists (like Vector but cooler), red-black trees, hash-based maps.
Java Collections Framework provides abstractions, so you can refer to a list as a List, whether backed by an array list or a linked list; and you can refer to a map/dictionary as a Map, whether backed by a red-black tree or a hashtable.
In other words, Java Collections Framework allows you to use the right data structure, because one size does not fit all.
