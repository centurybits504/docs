Multiple Catch blocks:

Multiple Catch blocks can be used when we're performing multiple task's that may cause multiple exceptions.

	/* Sample syntax for try& multiple catch block */
	try{
	//some statements which are likely to cause exceptions
	}catch(MostspecificExceptionClass object){
	//this will catch the exception and tells what to do  
	}
	catch(MostgeneralExceptionClass object){
	//this will catch the exception and tells what to do  
	}
 
Note:
	At a time only one catch block is executed.
	All catch blocks must be ordered from most-specific to most-general exceptions.
	For example catch for ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException must come before catch for Exception.
