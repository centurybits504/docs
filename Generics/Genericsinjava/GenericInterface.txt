Generic Interface:
A Generic interface represents a interface that is type-safe i.e, a generic interface can act on any datatype.
Generic interfaces are also called as "parameterized types", because they use a parameter that determines which datatypes should work on.
When a generic interface is written bythe programmer need not to rewrite the same interface when ever he want to use the same interface with a new datatype.

	class MyGenericClass<T>{
		//body
	}
