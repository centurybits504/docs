Generic Method:
Generic method is similar to declaring a generic type, but the type parameter's scope is limited to the method where it is declared. 
Static and non-static generic methods are allowed, as well as generic class constructors.
Sometimes we donâ€™t want whole class to be parameterized, in that case we can use generics type in methods also.
