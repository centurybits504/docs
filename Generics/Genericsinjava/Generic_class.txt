Generic Class:
A Generic class represents a class that is type-safe i.e, a generic class can act on any datatype.
Generic classes are also called as "parameterized types", because they use a parameter that determines which datatypes should work on.
When a generic class is written bythe programmer need n[t to rewrite the same class when ever he want to use the same class with a new datatype.
