In case of arrays we can always give the guarantee about the type of the elements.<br>
<br>
Generics are a facility of generic programming that was added to the java programming language in 2004 as part of J2SE5.0<br>
<br>
To provide type-safety to collections generics are introduced.<br>
They allows a type variable (or) method to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety.<br>
<br>
In case of arrays at the time of retrieval it is not required to perform any TypeCasting.<br>
For example:<br>
		String[] str = new String[10];<br>
	    str[0] = \"A\";<br>
	    str[1] = \"B\";<br>
		String name1 = str[0]; /*TypeCasting is not required*/<br>
		String name2 = str[1]; /*TypeCasting is not required*/<br>
					<br>
But in the case of collections at the time of retrieval compulsory we should perform typecasting otherwise we will get compile-time error.<br>
<br>
For example, if a programmer add integer in string type of collection, we dont get compile-time error but program may fail at run-time.<br>
<font color=\"#0091EA\"><b>/*Creating list, adding different type of elements and iterating*/</b></font>	<br>
				List list = new ArrayList();<br>
				list.add(\"A\");<br>
				list.add(\"B\");<br>
				list.add(new Integer(10));<br>
		<br><br>
				String s1= (String)list.get(0);<br>
				String s2= (String)list.get(1);<br>
				/*Here we get ClassCastException*/<br>
				String s3= (String)list.get(2);	<br>
/*Here there is no guarantee that collections can hold a particular type of objects. Hence writting collections are not safe to use.*/<br>
